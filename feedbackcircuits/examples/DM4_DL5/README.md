# DM4+DL5 Simulations

This folder contains three notebooks that create a group of execution results for the DM4 and DL5 glomeruli.

## How To Use

In order, go through these three notebooks:
* CircuitGeneration generates the circuit graphs to be executed,
* CircuitSimulation executes them,
* CircuitVisualization visualizes them.
