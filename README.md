# FeedbackCircuits
Feedback Circuits library for FlyBrainLab offers capabilities to visualize circuits from the point of view of feedback.

## Installation:

FeedbackCircuits uses pre-cached data for faster circuit generation.

* Download supporting files for Hemibrain for fast in-memory processing [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1HlgpnZLQCwkwjeOOuV7SD2ndWkVsr21F).
* Put the components in the NDComponents folder to your Neurodriver NDComponents folders.
* The ALGen.ipynb example shows how to generate specific AL circuits.
* The ALRun.ipynb example shows how to run specific AL circuits.
